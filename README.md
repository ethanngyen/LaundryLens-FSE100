# LaundryLens-FSE100
For our FSE100 project, our team was tasked with developing and building a technological device that would help visually impaired people with their daily lives. Our group decided to build glasses that would assist the visually impaired with sorting laundry by identifying the color and patterns of the clothing articles.

For our project, we used a pair of glasses, tape, headphones, raspberry pi, ultrasonic sensor, camera, vibrational module, button, wires, breadboard, and GPIO extension board to build our prototype. We used Python, OpenAI API Key, and Python pyttsx3 library to code the sensors and technologies we used in our prototype.

Our finished product was successful. We were able to successfully assist the user in distinguishing clothes based on their patterns and colors, and also produce a working demonstration of our project on our final day of class. Project documentation will be linked soon once finished.

Group members: Ethan Nguyen, Prince Solomon, Dhruva Aher, Piotr Jandura, Natalia Piatek, and Davey Nearman
