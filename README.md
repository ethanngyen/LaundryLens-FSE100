# LaundryLens-FSE100
For our FSE100 project, our team was tasked with developing and building a technological device that would help visually impaired people with their daily lives. Our group decided to build glasses that would assist the visually impaired with sorting laundry by identifying the color and patterns of the clothing articles.
